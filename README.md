The notebooks in this repo are an exposition of the math behind US Patent Application 14/718,804.
The notebooks can be viewed in several ways.
You can see them as static renderings on github.
You can clone the repo and open them using Jupyter (the were developed using Jupyter from the Anaconda3 distribution).
Or you can fire up a temporary jupyter server with a copy of the notebooks on mybinder.org by pressing the button above.
